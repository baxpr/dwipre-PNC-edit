# dwipre-PNC-edit

Preprocessing pipeline with FSL 5.0.11 eddy, specific to PNC DTI dataset.

This version uses a supplied brain mask instead of finding one with BET.


## Assumptions

- Only a single entry is allowed in acq_params file. It is applied to all DWI volumes.

- b=0 volumes are indicated with a value of exactly 0 in the bval files.


## Pipeline

1. For each run ("dti35" and "dti36"):

    a. A mean b=0 image is computed from all available b=0 volumes.
    
    b. BET is used to find a brain mask for the run.
    
    c. The mean intensity of in-brain voxels is computed.
    
    d. All DWI volumes of the run are scaled by a factor of 1000*(mean intensity).

2. The scaled images are combined into a single series.

3. A mean b=0 image for the combined series is computed, and BET is used to compute a brain mask from it.

4. EDDY is run on the combined series, using the mask from the previous step.
